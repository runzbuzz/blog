We explain the mechanism of TPool, a thread pool constructed in Python without relying on [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) or other 3rd party libraries. We relied on a single semaphore and two locks. Also the queue is used mainly for its blocking mechanism.


# What thread pools are used for?

Imagine that you have a thousands of processings that you would like to perform. You can either process them one by 
one or you can process multiple ones at the same time. Running them in paralled is generally faster than running them one by one.
