title: "From Idea to Alpha: Building BuzzSense.ai as a Solo Founder"
categories: [BuzzSense.ai, Startup, Founder Journey, Generative Engine Optimization]
description: "This is the first post in a series documenting my journey of building buzzsense.ai. Today, people use ChatGPT or Gemini to search for information, partially replacing search engines like Google and Bing. The problem is that businesses don't know how their brands are doing in these AI systems. That is why I am building buzzsense.ai, a platform to help businesses track and improve their visibility in AI chatbots and assistants. I am still in the early stages, and this week I finished the alpha version of the platform. In this post, I share the journey so far with the lessons I've learned along the way.

# Who I am 
My name is Ahmad Alobaid. I have two masters in AI and a PhD also in AI. After working at different universities as a lecturer and researcher in AI, I went to the private sector for an AI company focused on AI and cybersecurity. I did pretty well and developed a jailbreak that made headlines with more than 20 million views in a single month for the blog post I wrote for the company. 

<br>
I basically stumbled on the idea for buzzsense.ai during a conversation with a smart guy in Germany a smart guy in Germany, and the light bulb went on about how a brand or business could track their performance on AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini. I believed so much in this idea that I booked a flight and came back to Kuwait to build it.

# What I am building 
I am building a platform to help brands measure and improve their visibility in AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.). The term used to describe this is GEO, which stands for Generative Engine Optimization. It is just like SEO (Search Engine Optimization) but for the world of AI assistants and chatbots. 

<br>
The value proposition here is to help companies track their visibility over time in AI assistants. Obviously, I will be focusing on the local market of Kuwait as a starting point, and that is what I started testing.

<br>
I conducted tests on local companies in Kuwait, which I know, to assess the validity of buzzsense.ai. And then I did it for Runzbuzz (my startup).
 To my surprise, I found other startups (competitors) to those local companies and even to Runzbuzz that I didn't even know about, despite my googling. 


# The status of the app
After I memorized the songs they put in the cafe on repeat, I finally got the alpha version working properly as expected using ChatGPT and Gemini APIs (if you do not know what an API is, it is basically a way to call their systems to run the prompts).

<br>
I finished the alpha version and added some helpful automations so I don't have to do some of the admin work myself. I developed some admin pages that summarize many of the things happening without the need for me to look at the system internals, which takes time. This saved me around 90% of the manual admin work I was doing before.


# Lessons I learned so far. 
- "Eat your own dog food". I remember this was said to me by a bright postdoc at UPM, whose name is Freddy. When I started using the app for my brands, I began to notice things I liked and things I wanted. I put on the entrepreneur hat and looked at it critically, which resulted in a couple of changes that I enjoyed looking at (yes, charts are beautiful). 
- Do not underestimate the power of noise-cancelling headphones. You have no idea how many times I heard personal problems that distracted me. 
- Work on one thing at a time and focus on it 100%. This means saying no to intriguing offers and opportunities. 


# Next steps
- *Sales*. I already targeted some sectors and players to pitch them the platform. 
- *Payment*. I am waiting for the approval to use the payment with the Runzbuzz Technology Consulting Company bank account.
- *Marketing*. Next up is creating marketing content, talking to people, networking, and all that shabang
